#This section is about Dictionaries
#Dictionaries can have strings, floats, integers, lists, and other dictionaries within them
#Dictionaries are retrieved by key names 
#Dictionaries can not be sorted

#Lets define a dictionary
my_dict = {'key1:'value1','key2':'value2'} #Notice that we use curly brackets to define a dictionary
my_dict['key1'] #This will display value1
#Lets define another dictionary
item_prices = {'apple':'$1.00','bread':'$3.99','milk':$5.00'}
item_prices['apple'] #This will display $1.00


##I will add more to this at a later time
#Happy coding!
