#print is a function that will display the value inside 
#string is an ordered sequence of characters (str) ("Hello", 'Sam', "2000")
#integers are whole numbers (int) (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
#floating point is a number with decimal point (float) (2.5, 3.5, 1.23)
#list is an ordered sequence of objects (list) (10, "hello", 200.3) ##Lists are MUTABLE (able to be changed)
#Dictionaries unorderd key value pairs (dict) ("mykey": "value", "name": "Frankie")
#Tuples ordered immutable sequence of objects (tup) (10, "hello", 200.3) #CANNOT be changed
#Sets unodered collection of unique objects (set) ("a","b")
#Booleans logical value indicating True or False (bool)
#strings are the only one that needs '' or "" integers and floats do not need them


#Python follows PEMDAS rules 
2+1 #Will add numbers  
2-1 #Will subtract number
2/2 #Will divide numbers
2*2 #Will multiply numbers
7%4 #Will divide and show the remainder this operation is call modulo or mod
5%2 #Run this to see if 5 is even or odd if it spits out anything other than 0 it is odd
2**2 #This is exponents 2 to the power of 2
100 ** 0.5 #This will display the square root of 100
10 ** 2 #This will square 10
