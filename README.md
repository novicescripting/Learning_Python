# Learning_Python
Here are my notes following along to Jose Portilla's course "Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3".
I highly recommend enrolling in this course, as it is really easy to follow along and the lectures are high quality.
I will be breaking up what I've learned into smaller sections that way it is easier to read.
As I go through the course I will be including small tests to help you along the way.
Good luck and happy coding!
