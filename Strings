#This section is about strings
#Strings are not mutable 
#Strings can use indexing [] as well as concatination
my_string_1 = 'Hello World'
my_string_2 = 'How are you'
my_string_1 + my_string_2 #This will display 'Hello World How are you'
my_string_1.upper() #This will display HELLO WORLD
my_string_1.lower() #This will display hello world
my_string_1.split() #This is display [Hello' , 'World']

#This section is about using the .format() method with strings
print('this is my test string{}'.format('What do you think')) #This will display this is my test string What do you think
print('The {} {} {}'.format('quick','brown','fox')) #This will display The quick, brown, fox
print('The {q} {b} {f}'.format(q='quick',b='brown',f='fox')) #This will display The quick brown fox

#This section is about formated string literals
#Lets define a variable with the value of john
name = 'john'
print(f'Hello, his name is {name}') #This will display Hello, his name is john

##I will be adding more about strings at a later date
#Happy coding!
